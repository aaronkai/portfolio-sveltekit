## A Brochure Page for a Local Club

A local club had an existing website that was getting a little long in the tooth. It was hosted by Wordpress and suffered from injected ads and poor mobile performance.

I rewrote/updated the page using the Astro framework. I originally wrote it for SvelteKit, but I've been hearing great things about Astro and wanted to give it another shot. The end result is a multi-page site that is mostly vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. The scheduls page is dynamic and makes use of Svelte.

I did my best to maintain original assets and style, but I did update the ad copy.
