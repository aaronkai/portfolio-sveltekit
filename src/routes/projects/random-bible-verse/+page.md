## Back to Basics

I wanted to do a project that would allow me to practice Typescript and learn more about basic scripting functions like fetch without any frameworks in the way. I coded this project in raw HTML + Typescript with Vite.

The site is very basic. It pulls a random Bible verse from an API and displays it. You can pull preceeding and antecedent verses and display them, at least within the the current book. I didn't bother coding functionality that would allow you to traverse books or chapters.
