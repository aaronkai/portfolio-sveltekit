## ðŸ’ª A work in progress ðŸ’ª

I'm still working on this one. I wanted to start a new project, and I wanted to make myself a tool I couldn't find elsewhere.

I do a powerlifting workout routine called "Five Three One". Right now, the app takes your one-rep maxes as inputs and outputs your three week routine.

I wanted to work in React instead of Svelte because even though I think Svelte is superior, there do not seem to be many jobs using it.

The app works well enough to use right now, but there are still many improvements. I need to improve the 'wamup' and 'accessory' pages. The app currently has no backend. I was hoping to do store data in cookies to avoid needing a backend altogether, but I'm finding that Android is not storing cookies on my phone, which is a big issue.
